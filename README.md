# Branch_and_Bound_tutorial
In this repository, we go over a simple MILP model and manually create and explore the Branch &amp; Bound (B&amp;B) decision tree to show how the algorithm works. 
The are 2 main files:
- a .pdf with a relatively verbose description of B\&B, including insights into the Simplex method, and a fully worked-out example relate to the optimal selection of toppings for a build-your-own pizza under budget constraints
- a Python notebook that shows step-by-step how the B\B decision tree for the pizza example can be built and explored manually
