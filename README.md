# Branch_and_Bound_tutorial
In this repository, we go over a simple MILP model and manually create and explore the Branch &amp; Bound (B&amp;B) decision tree to show how the algorithm works. 
The are 2 main files:
- a .pdf with a relatively verbose description of B\&B, including insights into the Simplex method, and a fully worked-out example relate to the optimal selection of toppings for a build-your-own pizza under budget constraints
- a Python notebook that shows step-by-step how the B\B decision tree for the pizza example can be built and explored manually, and that then shows how the same solution is obtained by letting the solver (Gurobi in this case)
carry out the B\&B procedure on its own
